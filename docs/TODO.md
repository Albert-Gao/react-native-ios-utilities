# TODO (react-native-ios-utilities)



- [ ]  **Implement**: Import native code from `react-native-ios-popover`
- [ ] **Task**: Set initial version number for library.
	* E.g. If `react-native-ios-utilities` starts with version `2.x`, then all other libraries that use must also start with `2.x`.
		* Figure out shared major version between all libraries, i.e. among the other libraries, find the one that has the highest version number, then use that as the initial version number for this library.
		* Note: Increments in major version means breaking changes to the API.
